/**
 * Permissioned extension host.
 *
 * The code-trust boundary answers "may this repository-controlled module be loaded at all". It does
 * not change what an approved module may then do: imported into the main Kilo process, it would
 * inherit every authority that process has. This module answers the second question — *with what
 * authority does an approved extension run* — by not running it here at all.
 *
 * An approved extension is evaluated in a child process, launched under the OS sandbox profile Kilo
 * already ships (`sandbox-exec` on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux) with writes confined to a scratch
 * directory and the network denied. Privileged effects are not available to it directly; it asks the
 * main process through a closed set of operations, and each request is adjudicated by the same
 * security engine that adjudicates the model's own tool calls, carrying the extension's identity.
 *
 * What that does and does not buy is measured rather than asserted: `backendSupport()` decides whether
 * the OS profile could be applied at all, `confined` records the answer, and the benchmark's runtime
 * scenarios show which direct APIs the boundary actually stops on this machine. Where the profile is
 * unavailable the process boundary still removes shared memory and the host's module graph, and that
 * is all this module claims there.
