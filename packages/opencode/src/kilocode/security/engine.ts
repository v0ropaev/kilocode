/**
 * The central security engine: pure, deterministic, side-effect free.
 *
 * It receives an already normalised action plus the session context, applies the immutable hard
 * rules and the default policy, and reduces the evidence monotonically (DENY > ASK > ALLOW).
 * Any internal failure is a hard ASK, never a silent ALLOW.
 *
 * Additional evidence layers (package provenance, session secret state) do not decide on their own:
 * they hand structured evidence to {@link extend}, which folds it into the same monotonic reducer, so
 * a layer can only tighten a decision and never relax one.
