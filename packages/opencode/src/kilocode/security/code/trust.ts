/**
 * Trust boundary for executable project code.
 *
 * Everything else in Security Auto adjudicates *tool calls*. This module adjudicates something that
 * happens earlier and cannot be undone: the moment Kilo runs `import()` on a file it discovered. A
 * `.kilocode/tool/*.ts` file or a project-declared plugin executes its module scope at that instant —
 * before any tool exists to gate, before the sandbox, before the model has done anything. Merely
 * opening a session in a cloned repository is enough.
 *
 * The principle is `discovery != execution`: a candidate is found, resolved and classified from its
 * *path* and its declaring config's scope, and only then may it be imported.
 *
 * What is trusted, and why:
 * - `builtin` — Kilo's own code;
 * - `trusted-config` — a file inside the user's global config directory, or a dependency declared by
 *   the user's global config. This is user/admin configuration, a level above the project;
 * - `workspace` / `unknown` — repository-controlled or unattributable. Untrusted executable authority
 *   by default: it is imported only when the user has approved *that exact content*.
 *
 * Approval lives in the global config (`experimental.security_auto_code_trust`) and is keyed by the
 * SHA-256 of the file, never by its path alone: a path-only approval would let an attacker swap the
 * contents afterwards. Nothing about the source is stored — only the digest, and only by the user.
 *
 * A project config cannot grant this trust: the list is read from the global config exclusively, and
 * the module's own exports and metadata are never consulted, because reading them would require the
 * very import this boundary exists to prevent.
