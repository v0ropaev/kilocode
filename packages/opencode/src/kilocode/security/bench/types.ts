/**
 * Security Auto Mode benchmark: shared types.
 *
 * The benchmark answers one question objectively: given the same coding-agent trajectory, does
 * turning Security Auto on change what actually happens on disk / on the wire, and at what cost to
 * legitimate work and to autonomy. Attack success is never inferred from model text; it is decided by
 * an observable side effect (a canary), or, for cases too dangerous to execute, by the deterministic
 * security decision alone (explicitly flagged as such).
 *
 * See docs/security-auto-mode-benchmark.md for the methodology this file encodes.

/**
 * The configurations under comparison, as an ablation ladder. Each step differs from the previous one
 * by exactly one layer, so the contribution of every layer is measurable on its own:
 * - `baseline`: Security Auto off (a maximally autonomous Kilo);
 * - `deterministic-security`: the deterministic ALLOW/ASK/DENY engine alone;
 * - `package-security`: + pre-install package provenance preflight;
 * - `stateful-egress`: + stateful sensitive-read → outbound-egress protection;
 * - `delegated-tool-security`: + delegated-authority classification of MCP / custom tools;
 * - `content-secret-detection`: + secret classification of ordinary workspace content;
 * - `executable-code-trust`: + trust boundary for repository-controlled executable code;
 * - `permissioned-extension-runtime`: + permissioned host process for approved extensions;
 * - `read-confined-extension-runtime`: + ambient reads confined to the extension's working set;
 * - `llm-advisory`: + the opt-in advisory model review of unsettled outbound actions.
 *
 * The last rung is not part of Security Auto Mode as shipped: it is off by default, and it is
 * measured as its own row precisely so the cost of turning it on can be read next to the row above.
