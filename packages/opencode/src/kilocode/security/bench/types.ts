/**
 * Security Auto Mode benchmark: shared types.
 *
 * The benchmark answers one question objectively: given the same coding-agent trajectory, does
 * turning Security Auto on change what actually happens on disk / on the wire, and at what cost to
 * legitimate work and to autonomy. Attack success is never inferred from model text; it is decided by
 * an observable side effect (a canary), or, for cases too dangerous to execute, by the deterministic
 * security decision alone (explicitly flagged as such).
 *
 * See docs/security-auto-mode-benchmark.md for the methodology this file encodes.

 * - `package-security`: v1 + package provenance preflight (the package layer);
 * - `stateful-egress`: v1 + packages + stateful secret-egress protection (the egress layer) — i.e. all of v2;
 * - `delegated-tool-security`: v2 + delegated-authority classification of MCP / custom tools (v3);
 * - `content-secret-detection`: v3 + secret classification of ordinary workspace content (v4).
