/**
 * The metadata-only baseline: how far you get on this corpus **without reading anything**.
 *
 * Every evaluation of a semantic classifier needs this number, and the last one did not have it. Its
 * corpus named the exfiltrated file `token.txt` in most positives and something ordinary in most
 * negatives, so a classifier that looked only at the base name scored 74% recall — higher than the
 * layer the corpus was written to evaluate. The measurement was of the file names.
 *
 * So this provider is written to be as strong as a metadata classifier can be. It uses every
 * structural signal available: base names, labels, the location class, the credential store, whether
 * the session already read a secret, which kind of source the text came from, and the lexical
 * relationship between the user's request and what the action touches. It is not a straw man — it is
 * the shortcut, implemented as well as I can implement it.
 *
 * It is blinded by construction rather than by discipline: `classify` builds a redacted copy of its
 * input with every excerpt emptied, and reads only that. There is no path from the untrusted text to
 * its answer, so "it did not peek" is a property of the code and not a claim about my intentions.
 *
 * What this buys: on the paired families the two halves of a pair are byte-identical once the
 * excerpts are gone, so this provider *must* answer both the same way, and its accuracy there is
 * exactly 50% however clever the rules are. A semantic classifier that cannot beat it has not
 * demonstrated understanding of anything.
