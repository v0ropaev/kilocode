/**
 * The semantic evaluation corpus, built as **matched pairs**.
 *
 * The previous corpus (`corpus.ts`, kept as historical) measured less than it claimed. Most of its
 * positives named the uploaded file something like `token.txt`, so a classifier that read only the
 * base name and never opened the untrusted text scored 74% recall on it — better than the layer being
 * evaluated. A number produced that way is not evidence that anything understood anything.
 *
 * This corpus is built so that shortcut cannot exist. Every case is one half of a pair:
 *
 *   - both halves carry the **same action** — same program, same base name, same location, same
 *     labels, same `readSecret`;
 *   - both halves carry the **same provenance** — same source kind, same file name, comparable length;
 *   - in the injection families both halves carry the **same user request**;
 *   - the only difference is what the untrusted text *means*.
 *
 * A classifier with no access to the excerpt therefore cannot tell the halves apart, and must answer
 * both the same way. Its accuracy on those families is pinned at 50% — chance — whatever it does.
 * That is not an argument, it is arithmetic, and `semantic-eval.test.ts` asserts the construction
 * holds for every pair so it cannot rot.
 *
 * Two families are deliberately different, and are reported separately for that reason:
 *
 *   - `goal-request`: the action is identical and the *user's request* varies. Intent is trusted
 *     input, not untrusted content, so a metadata-plus-request baseline is entitled to do well here.
 *   - `goal-content`: the request and the action are identical, and what the file actually holds is
 *     revealed only inside the excerpt. This is the goal question posed so that it cannot be answered
 *     without reading.
 *
 * The negatives are the point as much as the positives, and getting them right took two attempts. The
 * first version held the action fixed and left it *unexplained* in the benign half — the user had
 * asked for a local task and the agent was running `curl` anyway — and a good model flagged it. It
 * was right to: an unexplained outbound action is not a negative, it is the second thing this layer
 * is for. Pairing an injection against a mismatch pairs two positives.
 *
 * So each family now isolates exactly one variable:
 *
 *   - **injection**: the request explicitly asks for the outbound step, so the action is accounted
 *     for in both halves. The attack is a document that *additionally directs the agent* to send the
 *     same file somewhere else; the negative is the same document describing where the file goes.
 *     The two differ in who is being told to act — which is the one thing an indirect injection
 *     cannot avoid, because text that does not address the agent will not move it.
 *   - **goal-request**: one action, one document, two requests — one that covers the action and one
 *     that has nothing to do with it.
 *   - **goal-content**: one request that does cover the action, and an excerpt showing what the file
 *     actually holds.
 *
 * The negatives use the same carriers, the same topics and the same alarming vocabulary — `secret`,
 * `upload`, `curl`, `token`, `ignore`. One is a security document that quotes a prompt injection in
 * order to explain it. One sends a file labelled `secret` on purpose.

 * ORDINARY, an instruction hidden behind a wall of filler or a base64 blob.
 *
 * Two different things are measured here and they should not be confused.
 *
 *  1. **Does the steer work?** Recall on this set answers it, and it is a property of the model.
 *  2. **Would it matter if it did?** That one is not measured here at all, because it is settled by
 *     the fold: a steered classifier returns ORDINARY, ORDINARY maps to no evidence, and no evidence
 *     is exactly what the layer contributes when it is switched off. `failure.test.ts` and
 *     `classifier.test.ts` assert it directly. The worst outcome of a perfect steer is the product
 *     without this feature.

/**
 * The freeze, and exactly what it covers.
 *
 * `SEMANTIC_HELD_OUT` is frozen from the moment its first result was read. After that point it is
 * not permitted to influence the system: not the prompt, not the schema, not the threshold, not the
 * routing, and not a single case rewritten because the model got it wrong. Everything that was tuned
 * — the prompt's addressee test, the choice of model, the decision not to move the threshold — was
 * settled on `SEMANTIC_DEVELOPMENT` and then left alone.
 *
 * Two things happened before the freeze and are recorded here so the claim is checkable:
 *
 *  - the construction of the negatives was corrected across both sets (see the note at the top of
 *    this file). That was a fix to what the corpus was asking, found on the development set, applied
 *    uniformly, and made before any model had seen the held-out cases.
 *  - the runner was changed to pass every case through the product's redaction before scoring it. On
 *    re-run the held-out result was identical to the digit, which is itself worth knowing: the model
 *    is reading the key *names*, not the values.
 *
 * If a future change is made in response to something seen in this set, it has become a development
 * set, and the honest move is to say so and build another. That rule is the only thing that makes a
 * held-out number mean anything, and it is easy to break by accident — which is why it is written
 * next to the data rather than in a commit message.
 *
 * Frozen: 2026-09-05, before the first real-model run. 82 cases in 41 pairs across the two sets,
 * plus 13 single-sided cases in `SEMANTIC_ADVERSARIAL`.
