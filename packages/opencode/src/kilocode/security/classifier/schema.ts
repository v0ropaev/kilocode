/**
 * The semantic layer's vocabulary, its prompt, and the parsing of what comes back.
 *
 * Three things live here together on purpose: what the model may say, how it is asked, and how the
 * answer is read. Keeping them apart is how a classifier ends up accepting prose it was never
 * supposed to accept.
 *
 * The layer's whole input is untrusted by construction — it exists to read text written by whoever
 * controls a repository, a dependency, a web page or an MCP server. So the prompt is built as if the
 * content were hostile, because it is:
 *
 *  - the content is never concatenated into the instruction. It sits inside a delimiter carrying a
 *    per-call random nonce, so nothing in the text can close the block or open a new one;
 *  - the instruction says, in advance, that everything inside the block is data and that instructions
 *    found there are the subject of the question rather than instructions to follow;
 *  - the answer vocabulary is closed and parsed exactly. Prose, refusals, JSON, a forged verdict
 *    inside the content — all read as "no signal";
 *  - content is truncated, so a long document cannot push the instruction out of the model's view.
 *
 * None of that is load-bearing on its own. What makes injection into this layer uninteresting is
 * that the layer can only ever *tighten* a decision: the best an attacker can do by steering it is
 * to be judged ordinary, which is exactly what happens when the layer is switched off.

 * wrong, which is the kind of thing an evaluation only tells you if its negatives are honest.
