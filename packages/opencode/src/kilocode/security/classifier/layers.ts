/**
 * The semantic security layer.
 *
 * Security Auto Mode's authority is the deterministic engine. This layer is a *witness*: it looks at
 * a decision the engine could not settle and may say "the text that led here was telling the agent to
 * do this". What it says never becomes a decision on its own — it becomes one more piece of evidence,
 * folded through the same monotone reducer every other layer uses.
 *
 * That is the whole design, and it is why the invariants are not a list of `if` statements:
 *
 *   `Decision.reduce` folds evidence with `stricter()`, starting from ALLOW. Appending evidence can
 *   move a decision towards ASK or DENY and can never move it back. A layer that only ever *appends*
 *   is, structurally, incapable of relaxing anything.
 *
 * Concretely, and provably rather than by convention:
 *   - a deterministic DENY stays DENY, whatever the model says;
 *   - a hard ASK stays a hard ASK;
 *   - the model can never produce ALLOW, because ALLOW is the identity of the fold, not a value this
 *     layer can contribute. `BENIGN_CONTEXT` is in the vocabulary so the model has somewhere to put
 *     "I looked and this is fine", and it maps to no evidence at all — the only representation of a
 *     benign verdict that cannot be turned into permission;
 *   - the model can never produce DENY either. It contributes an ASK. A layer whose input is a model
 *     may insist on a person; it may not end the task on its own judgement.
 *
 * What changed from the action-only version: that one judged the command. It caught an upload whose
 * *file name* looked like a secret and missed every case where the secret was staged through a file
 * called `staged.dat` first — because the name is all it had. This one is given the untrusted text
 * the session actually read, which is where the meaning was the whole time.
