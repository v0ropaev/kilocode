/**
 * Delegated-authority evaluation for tool calls.
 *
 * The layer answers one question the engine could not answer before: *may this tool run at all,
 * given who wrote it and what it is allowed to do*. It produces structured evidence for the same
 * monotonic reducer as every other layer, so it can only tighten a decision.
 *
 * What it enforces:
 * - a tool whose authority nothing vouches for (unclassified custom tool, unclassified MCP tool,
 *   a built-in absent from the capability table) is never a silent ALLOW: the floor is a hard ASK;
 * - what the tool *says about itself* — an MCP annotation, a plugin's own metadata — may tighten a
 *   decision and never relax one, so lying about being read-only cannot help an attacker;
 * - the arguments of an unvetted tool are classified with the same path policy as a shell command,
 *   so "custom tool writes to ~/.ssh" or "MCP tool rewrites the Kilo config" is refused for the same
 *   reason the shell equivalent is;
 * - composition with the session's secret state: an outbound or unvetted tool call made
 *   while the session holds credential material needs a human, and a call that literally carries a
 *   value read from a credential this session is refused.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do: read the tool's natural-language description, classify tools by
 * name, or block MCP as a category. An ordinary read-only MCP call with no secret context produces
 * no evidence at all and keeps the pre-existing low-friction path.
